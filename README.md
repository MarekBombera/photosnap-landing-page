# Photosnap

Technologies: React, Typescript, Sass
Testing: Jest, React-Testing-Library

- Built mobile-first
- TDD

Photosnap is a website for a fictional company.

I tried to build the website mainly with CSS Grid, but I still used some Flexbox where it made sense.

Also, this is my first project where I used TDD. It made me think differently about my code structure and how I'm planning to write it.

Although it did take longer initially, TDD gave me confidence that I didn't break something, and when I did I knew where the problem was, so debugging was much easier.
